# subtask1.py
## Environment
Python 3.6 and PyTorch 0.4.1 are recommended.
## Execution
```
$ python3 subtask1.py
```
## Outcome
This program loads CIFAR-10 to the same directory of its.

Several lines will be printed to the terminal including results of each epoch and total execution time.

A picture named "Loss.png" is created after each execution.
```
Epoch: 0, train loss = 2.3226, validation loss = 2.3078
Epoch: 1, train loss = 2.3098, validation loss = 2.3063
Epoch: 2, train loss = 2.3070, validation loss = 2.3046
Epoch: 3, train loss = 2.3059, validation loss = 2.3048
...
Finished training 20 epochs.
5.6309 minutes elapsed.

# subtask2.py
## Environment
Python 3.6 and PyTorch 0.4.1 are recommended.
## Execution
```
$ python3 subtask2.py
```

A picture named "Loss.png" and a picture named "accuracy.png" are created after execution.

# flatness1.py
## Environment
Python 3.6 and PyTorch 0.4.1 are recommended.
## Execution
```
$ python3 flatness1.py
```
## Outcome
This program will downloads MNIST dataset, and trains two models.

Final result will be shew on the terminal and save as "flatness1.png"


# flatness2.py
## Environment
Python 3.6 and PyTorch 0.4.1 are recommended.
## Execution
```
$ python3 flatness2.py
```
## Outcome
This program will downloads CIFAR-10 dataset, and trains five models with different bathc size.

Final results will be shew on the terminal and save as "sensitivity_loss.png" and "sensitivity_acc.png"

This program requires more time to run.
