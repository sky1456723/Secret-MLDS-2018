## Execution
```
"HW2_final.ipynb" shows the entire training process and you can click it for details.
"HW2_test.ipynb" shows the testing results.

You can open a python file and load "s2vt_1025_2_old.pkl" to test our model.
Some of the sample results are in "output1025_pass baseline.txt".

"S2VT.py" is the model we built.
"readin_raw.py" includes the codes for data preprocessing.
